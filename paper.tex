\begin{abstract}
 \tavs~is a destructible tower defense game that explores the viability of short term evolution of neural nets for pathfinding in an adapting adversarial environment.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\tavs~is a real-time tower defense game with evolving enemies; which is to say that the player places down towers and other defenses in real time to fend off waves of enemies attempting to destroy the player's "home base." In typical tower defense games, after killing one group of enemies, another comes which is usually stronger than the previous, due to a pre-ordained set of constraints. \textit{They are Very Smart} differs from typical tower defense games in that enemy progression is not determined by divine force (i.e., the game developer), but rather evolves as a result of a genetic algorithm which controls the enemies' damage, movement speed, health, and navigation.

    \item Central defensible location
    \item Economy
    \item Game end/lack thereof
\end{itemize}


\tavs was initially inspired by Numantian Games' \textit{They Are Billions}, a game in which a player must build defenses in order to fend off a zombie apocalypse. The game features massive numbers of zombies. This project emerged from an interest in what \textit{They Are Billions} would be like if the zombies could actually think for themselves. The result is significantly pared down in comparison, as the focus has been on zombie evolution as opposed to player interactivity and enjoyability. However, similiarities to \textit{They Are Billions} can be seen in the resource management system, the player's defense of a citadel, and need to fend off the faceless hordes. \textit{They Are Billions} puts additional emphasis on world generation, player exploration, and narrative elements.

\section{Background}
In \tavs, we utilize a basic genetic algorithm to train a recurrent neural network generated using the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, ~cite http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/~ with https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/, which is a generalized deep-learning library that includes implementations of NEAT and HyperNEAT.

NEAT is particularly applicable to our issue because it allows the evolution of different topologies and weights in neural networks at the same time, unlike standard back-propagation learning, and is also well-suited for encoding into a genome for evolution. NEAT works essentially by encoding a function that then generates a neural net (citation needed), starting out with low complexity of topology, which can then evolve towards more complex topologies.

\subsection{Running the game}
Our game can be found at
\href{https://github.com/YourFin/They-Are-Very-Smart}{github.com/yourfin/They-Are-Very-Smart},
and downloaded with a standard \texttt{git clone} command. The relevant unity
scene is then located at
\texttt{They-Are-Very-Smart/TD/TowerDefence/Assets/Scenes/Levels/Level0/Level0.unity}
Double clicking on this file on any computer with unity installed will open up
the unity editor with the context for this paper.

\section{Preliminary Results and Discussion}
Over the course of this project, we learned more about game design than we did evolutionary algorithms and artificial life. The majority of our time working on this project was spent dealing with learning the basics of Unity and C\#, which presented a very significant challenge that we vastly underestimated.

At this time, we are currently waiting on actual results from our project, but we hope that given a large enough population of zombies, we might see populations of zombies evolving to counteract players' strategies, although we may also see players coming up with ways to counteract the zombies by exploiting elements of the fitness function and construction system in ways unforeseen, possibly by playing in such a way as to allow the zombies to optimize for something other than killing the player's home base. Another possibility we might expect to see is the development of swarm or anti-swarm behavior based on the effectiveness of player defenses, as well as zombies possibly hitting minima or maxima depending on hard-coded numbers in the game environment.

In the future, we would experiment with elements such as variable damage output from towers and other defenses (so as to avoid the aforementioned numeric minima and maxima), as well as coming up with ways to encourage attacking the player's base more as time goes on.

Ultimately, we think that although evolution was the appropriate mechanism to to solve the issue at hand, game development was not the appropriate environment for this topic, given the time investment.
